        <h1>About This Project</h1>
        <p>
          This website was created for the WEB222 course assignment and displays a vibrant,
          adaptable design that includes a product gallery, an about section, and a statement of
          honesty policy. The main goal of this project is to showcase skills in HTML, CSS, and
          responsive web design. Each page is meticulously designed to provide a smooth user
          experience on a variety of devices and screen sizes. A notable feature is the product
          gallery on the homepage, which offers an attractive and user-friendly layout for
          displaying items. More than just an academic task, this project exemplifies the real-world
          application of web development skills acquired during the course.
